STM32F103RBT6 with 4 ultrasonic sensors control

Controlling 4 ultrasonic sensors, which is annonying as I don't know why the readings so strange.

And, this time I think interrupt is no need so far but if there has a four channel timer capture mode, it is kind of 

wasting peripherals.

Kind of need to improve the code for the need for 2 push buttons.

This is originally the shopping cart project i am doing, the breaking system is developed by other two mechanical students which

THEY STILL DOING CALCULATION ADN HAVE NOT DONE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT.
